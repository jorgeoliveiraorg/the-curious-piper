## Category calibration (pick the block that matches your primary style)
> Keep this short—tick the “tells” that proved the category.

### If #1–2 Modern aromatics
- [ ] Top note stayed present beyond mid-bowl
- [ ] Top note faded mid-bowl
- [ ] Turned sharp/solvent when pushed
- [ ] Steam bite / gurgle management was central
- **Most helpful tip:** [dry time / looser pack / cadence]

### If #3–4 Traditional scented / Lakeland
- [ ] Scent felt integrated (not candy)
- [ ] Kendal/Lakeland “house essence” was obvious and persistent
- [ ] Ghosting was strong (dedicated pipe recommended)
- **Most helpful tip:** [cooler smoke / dedicated pipe / drying]

### If #5–7 Virginia-family
- [ ] Flavor improved as temperature dropped
- [ ] Bite threshold was clear (too wet / too fast)
- [ ] Perique was definitional on retrohale (only for #6)
- **Most helpful tip:** [dry more / sip slower / smaller bowl]

### If #8–10 Burley-family
- [ ] Cocoa/nut/wood “structure” led the profile
- [ ] Harsh/ashy appeared only when over-fired
- [ ] Strength crept up with pace (common VaBur tell)
- **Most helpful tip:** [avoid over-firing / steady cadence]

### If #11 Oriental showcase (no Latakia)
- [ ] Incense/mineral/sour-spice led; no Latakia frame detected
- [ ] Acrid only when overheated
- **Most helpful tip:** [gentler heat / don’t over-dry]

### If #12–15 English/Balkan spectrum
- [ ] Sweetening/Cavendish smoothing is part of identity (#12)
- [ ] Orientals led; Latakia shaded (#13)
- [ ] Latakia was the engine (#14)
- [ ] Orientals drove; Latakia framed (Balkan gravity) (#15)
- **Most helpful tip:** [avoid heat spikes / preserve Oriental nuance]

### If #16 Dark-fired Kentucky
- [ ] BBQ/earth/char-sweet signature (not Latakia incense)
- [ ] Nicotine management mattered
- **Most helpful tip:** [small bowl / slow cadence / dry time]

### If #17 Rope/Twist/Plug (form-driven)
- [ ] Format and portion size defined the experience
- [ ] Best as micro-dose bowl(s)
- **Most helpful tip:** [slice thin / dry portion / small chamber]

### If #18 Cigar-leaf crossover
- [ ] Cigar leaf thickened body/texture noticeably
- [ ] Finish was cigar-adjacent; palate fatigue noted
- **Most helpful tip:** [slower pace / smaller bowl / dedicated pipe if needed]

---
